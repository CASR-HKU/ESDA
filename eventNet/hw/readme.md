# Archived Hardware Projects

This folder contains all the archived hardware source code/bitstream for our designs. The folder with `0p5` refers to MobileNetV2(Width Multiplier=0.5) while the rest are the researched `ESDA-Net` in the paper.

To resynthesis the exact hardware using Vivado, you can go to each folder and `make hw_all`.
